#Stillmaker
Uses [ffmpeg](http://www.ffmpeg.org/) and [streamio-ffmpeg](https://github.com/streamio/streamio-ffmpeg) to take a bunch of screenshots of a video file.

###Setup
`brew install ffmpeg`  
`bundle install`

###How to use
1. Put a video file in the project root directory.
2. `ruby stillmaker.rb`
3. Follow the directions at the command prompt.

###Why?
I find that film stills are a great reference for improving drawing skills. I wrote this so that I could easily build a library of stills from a video file.
